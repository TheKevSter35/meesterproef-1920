## Debriefing

In a society where we make extensive use of the digital world. we are used to pass our data to a company. For example a subscription, store or webshop.  it makes life a lot easier. But if we pass on our data what is being done with it? Amsterdammers with little to no digital skills easily give them their data away to companies, but have no idea what they can do with their data.

Together with the clients: Ontwerplab OBA en ontwerpcollectief idiotÄ“s. We will start developing a digital interactive product within 5-6 weeks to give non-digital skills Amsterdammers more transpiratie about their data and what it will / can be used for.
